### Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js if you haven't already.

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```shell
   cd frontend
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Python Pages application.
